This Blender add-on lets you create OpenDRIVE/OpenSCENARIO based scenarios for
testing of assistant and autonomous driving functions.

## License

The source code of this tool is distributed under the GPL version 3.0 license as
required for all Blender add-ons. Note, that this does not imply that the tool
can not be used in a commercial context. In fact, there is probably no issue
using it in the same way as you would use Blender itself, Linux or GCC since you
will probably not be modifying the source code and/or linking against it without
contributing back your changes.

Furthermore, if your enterprise company has already reached a state where open
source contribution is possible, your contributions and pull requests are
welcomed if they are maintainable.

## Credits

Credits go to the [Archipack](https://github.com/s-leger/archipack) add-on
developer(s). I took some inspiration from them for the menu and tool design.
